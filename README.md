# ASTROVO — Single & Multiplayer (1v1)

- Start screen shows **Single Player** and **Multiplayer**.
- Multiplayer overlay: **Your name** + **Room code** → **Create Room** (host) or **Join Room** (guest).
- Host clicks **Start 1v1**. Host is authoritative: spawns are broadcast so both players get identical obstacles / coins / power-ups.

## Run on Replit
1. Create Node.js repl, upload repo (or import from GitHub).
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` (auto via `.replit`).

Open the webview; for multiplayer open in two separate browsers and use the same room code.
